My name is Jasper Sarong
I love playing different sports.
I also love listening to different genres of music.
I am an animal lover.
I tend to call and touch a cat whenever I see one on the streets.
I am a person who cares about others around me.
I tend to suppress my own behavior and words.
Sometimes I resolutely cut ties with the past in ice-cold ways,
but once I believe that person is a true friend, 
I will share everything and be very affectionate.

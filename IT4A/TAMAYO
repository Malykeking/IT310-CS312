My name is Daniel Francisco Tamayo
I was born on the 5th of December
I love dogs
I like lying down on a serene place
I love the horizon
I don't like math subjects
I love watching anime
Definitely, normal paced actions and speed suite me best
Not really good dealing with pressure
Often get left behind by everyone
